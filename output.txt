Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future, by Peter Thiel

The Old Economy couldn’t handle the challenges of globalization. Something needed to work—and work in a big way—if the future was going to be better at all. By indirect proof, the New Economy of the internet was the only way forward., loc. 178-180, 2021-06-16 14:53:40

It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4. Sales matters just as much as product., loc. 237-239, 2021-06-16 18:56:58

Monopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great monopoly invites being audited, scrutinized, and attacked. Since they very much want their monopoly profits to continue unmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of their (nonexistent) competition., loc. 282-284, 2021-06-16 18:58:48

Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie: “we’re in a league of our own.” Entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make., loc. 299-300, 2021-06-16 18:59:42

Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie: “we’re in a league of our own.” Entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition., loc. 299-301, 2021-06-16 18:59:49

Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets: British food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto Rap star ∩ hackers ∩ sharks Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars, loc. 320-324, 2021-06-16 19:00:42

MBA students carry around copies of Clausewitz and Sun Tzu.

War metaphors invade our everyday business language: we use headhunters to build up a sales force that will enable us to take a captive market and make a killing. But really it’s competition, not business, that is like war: allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive., loc. 408-410, 2021-06-16 19:07:13

you’re less sensitive to social cues, you’re less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you. If you’re interested in making things or programming computers, you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them. Then when you apply your skills, you’re a little less likely than others to give up your own convictions: this can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes., loc. 438-441, 2021-06-16 19:09:21

When we released the PayPal product in late 1999, Elon Musk’s X.com was right on our heels: our companies’ offices were four blocks apart on University Avenue in Palo Alto, and X’s product mirrored ours feature-for-feature. By late 1999, we were in all-out war. Many of us at PayPal logged 100-hour workweeks. No doubt that was counterproductive, but the focus wasn’t on objective productivity; the focus was defeating X.com., loc. 464-467, 2021-06-16 19:11:26

If you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already more sane than most., loc. 481-482, 2021-06-16 19:12:57

Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is., loc. 589-591, 2021-06-16 22:04:35

The overall dynamic was net positive, unlike Napster’s negative-sum struggle with the U.S. recording industry. As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible., loc. 639-641, 2021-06-17 18:44:37

A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket., loc. 887-889, 2021-06-17 21:06:16

Whatever Einstein did or didn’t say, the power law—so named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions—is the law of the universe., loc. 903-904, 2021-06-17 21:07:32

If you focus on diversification instead of single-minded pursuit of the very few companies that can become overwhelmingly valuable, you’ll miss those rare companies in the first place., loc. 925-926, 2021-06-17 21:08:45

This implies two very strange rules for VCs. First, only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund. This is a scary rule, because it eliminates the vast majority of possible investments. (Even quite successful companies usually succeed on a more humble scale.) This leads to rule number two: because rule number one is so restrictive, there can’t be any other rules., loc. 932-935, 2021-06-17 21:09:45

This is why investors typically put a lot more money into any company worth funding., loc. 939-939, 2021-06-17 21:10:38

Of course, no one can know with certainty ex ante which companies will succeed, so even the best VC firms have a “portfolio.” However, every single company in a good venture portfolio must have the potential to succeed at vast scale., loc. 941-943, 2021-06-17 21:11:14

Companies are like countries in this way. Bad decisions made early on—if you choose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example—are very hard to correct after they are made. It may take a crisis on the order of bankruptcy before anybody will even try to correct them. As a founder, your first job is to get the first things right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation., loc. 1176-1179, 2021-06-18 20:53:37

If a CEO doesn’t set an example by taking the lowest salary in the company, he can do the same thing by drawing the highest salary. So long as that figure is still modest, it sets an effective ceiling on cash compensation., loc. 1254-1256, 2021-06-18 21:00:40

Since it’s impossible to achieve perfect fairness when distributing ownership, founders would do well to keep the details secret. Sending out a company-wide email that lists everyone’s ownership stake would be like dropping a nuclear bomb on your office., loc. 1270-1272, 2021-06-18 21:02:32

The only good answers are specific to your company, so you won’t find them in this book. But there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. You’ll attract the employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling: not why it’s important in general, but why you’re doing something important that no one else is going to get done., loc. 1325-1328, 2021-06-18 21:06:51

The biggest difference is that cults tend to be fanatically wrong about something important. People at a successful startup are fanatically right about something those outside it have missed. You’re not going to learn those kinds of secrets from consultants, and you don’t need to worry if your company doesn’t make sense to conventional professionals.

Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business (20th Anniversary Edition), by 

The point I am leading to by this and the previous examples is that the concept of truth is intimately linked to the biases of forms of expression., loc. 490-491, 2021-06-15 07:47:17

I hope to persuade you that the decline of a print-based epistemology and the accompanying rise of a television-based epistemology has had grave consequences for public life, that we are getting sillier by the minute., loc. 514-515, 2021-06-15 07:49:41

Every philosophy is the philosophy of a stage of life, Nietzsche remarked. To which we might add that every epistemology is the epistemology of a stage of media development., loc. 519-521, 2021-06-15 07:55:14

In the next two chapters I want to show that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, America was such a place, perhaps the most print-oriented culture ever to have existed. In subsequent chapters, I want to show that in the twentieth century, our notions of truth and our ideas of intelligence have changed as a result of new media displacing the old., loc. 548-551, 2021-06-15 07:59:21

The third point is that in the analogy I have drawn above, the river refers largely to what we call public discourse—our political, religious, informational and commercial forms of conversation. I am arguing that a television-based epistemology pollutes public communication and its surrounding landscape, not that it pollutes everything., loc. 577-580, 2021-06-15 08:01:44

The second point is that the epistemological shift I have intimated, and will describe in detail, has not yet included (and perhaps never will include) everyone and everything., loc. 562-563, 2021-06-15 08:01:53

The first is that at no point do I care to claim that changes in media bring about changes in the structure of people’s minds or changes in their cognitive capacities., loc. 553-554, 2021-06-15 08:01:59

Media change does not necessarily result in equilibrium. It sometimes creates more than it destroys. Sometimes, it is the other way around. We must be careful in praising or condemning because the future may hold surprises for us. The invention of the printing press itself is a paradigmatic example. Typography fostered the modern idea of individuality, but it destroyed the medieval sense of community and integration. Typography created prose but made poetry into an exotic and elitist form of expression. Typography made modern science possible but transformed religious sensibility into mere superstition. Typography assisted in the growth of the nation-state but thereby made patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion., loc. 586-591, 2021-06-15 08:03:23

When we were first drawn together as a society, it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors, and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths. From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been improving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should feel ourselves as if bound and confined by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement, and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from., loc. 604-609, 2021-06-15 08:06:01

Whatever else may be said of those immigrants who came to settle in New England, it is a paramount fact that they and their heirs were dedicated and skillful readers whose religious sensibilities, political ideas and social life were embedded in the medium of typography., loc. 617-619, 2021-06-15 12:21:01

although literacy rates are notoriously difficult to assess, there is sufficient evidence (mostly drawn from signatures) that between 1640 and 1700, the literacy rate for men in Massachusetts and Connecticut was somewhere between 89 percent and 95 percent, quite probably the highest concentration of literate males to be found anywhere in the world at that time., loc. 622-625, 2021-06-15 12:22:09

In a culture dominated by print, public discourse tends to be characterized by a coherent, orderly arrangement of facts and ideas.

This nurtured a sense of dependency, not a spirit of self-reliance. Healey in 1967 had promised "significant aid " to offset the loss from the rundown of British forces. I was convinced our people must never have an aid-dependent mentality., loc. 900-902, 2021-06-12 22:16:48

We made it illegal for a trade union to take strike or industrial action without a secret ballot. If it did so , the union and its officers would be liable to prosecution. This stopped the practice of voting by an open show of hands where dissenters were intimidated into acquiescence., loc. 1526-1528, 2021-06-13 08:36:33

We believed in socialism, in fair shares for all. Later we learned that personal motivation and personal rewards were essential for a productive economy. However, because people are unequal in their abilities, if performance and rewards are determined by the marketplace, there will be a few big winners, many medium winners, and a considerable number of losers. That would make for social tensions because a society's sense of fairness is offended., loc. 1630-1633, 2021-06-13 08:40:19

It was difficult to counter the seductiveness of welfare promises by the opposition during elections. In the 1960s and 1970s , the failure of the European welfare state was not yet self-evident . It took two generations for the harm to work its way through and be seen in lowered performance of individuals, sluggish growth rates, and growing budget deficits., loc. 1789-1791, 2021-06-13 08:47:15

The CPF and home ownership have ensured political stability, the foundation upon which Singapore grew and developed without interruption for more than 30 years. Singaporeans are unlike their counterparts in Hong Kong, Taipei , Seoul, or Tokyo, who have high wages but pay vast rents for tiny rooms which they will never own. Such an electorate would not have reelected the PAP with solid majorities in successive elections., loc. 1804-1807, 2021-06-13 08:48:34

The more yang (male) competitiveness in society, the higher the total performance. If winner takes all , competition will be keen, but group solidarity weak. The more yin (female) solidarity, with rewards evenly redistributed , the greater the group solidarity, but the weaker the total performance because of reduced competition., loc. 1812-1815, 2021-06-13 08:49:25

There will always be the irresponsible or the incapable, some 5 percent of our population. They will run through any asset, whether a house or shares. We try hard to make them as independent as possible and not end up in welfare homes. More important, we try to rescue their children from repeating the feckless ways of their parents. We have arranged help but in such a way that only those who have no other choice will seek it. This is the opposite of attitudes in the West, where liberals actively encourage people to demand their entitlements with no sense of shame, causing an explosion of welfare costs., loc. 1818-1822, 2021-06-13 08:50:14

The capabilities of most children were between those of their two parents, with a few having lower or higher intelligence than either. Therefore, male graduates who married less-educated women were not maximizing the chances of having children who make it to university. I urged them to marry their educational equals, and encouraged educated women to have two or more children., loc. 2265-2267, 2021-06-13 14:53:12

The British used to have whipping with a cat-o' -nine-tails or rattan in Singapore. After the war, they abolished whipping but retained caning (with rattan). We found caning more effective than long prison terms and imposed it for crimes related to drugs, arms trafficking, rape, illegal entry into Singapore, and vandalizing of public property. In 1993, a 1 5-year-old American schoolboy, Michael Fay, and his friends went on a spree, vandalizing road and traffic signs and spraypainting more than 20 cars. When charged in court, he pleaded guilty and his lawyer made a plea for leniency., loc. 3449-3453, 2021-06-13 15:50:36

To speak of Singapore-Malaysia problems as "historical baggage" is to miss the point. If it had been only "historical baggage," then after more than 30 years as two independent states, our relations should have stabilized. But the root cause of the recurring problems in Singapore-Malaysia relations is our diametrically different approaches to the problems facing our two multiracial societies., loc. 4100-4103, 2021-06-13 16:22:21

During one exchange over dinner, I remarked that Indonesia was blessed with very fertile soil, a favorable climate, and abundant resources.

In spite of my experiences during the Japanese occupation and the Japanese traits I had learned to fear, I now respect and admire them. Their group solidarity, discipline, intelligence, industriousness, and willingness to sacrifice for their nation make them a formidable and productive force. Conscious of the poverty of their resources, they will continue to make that extra effort to achieve the unachievable., loc. 8477-8480, 2021-06-13 22:38:10

Korean elite, including Prime Minister Choi and his wife, both completely at home in Japanese language, literature, and culture, there was an underlying antipathy toward their former rulers. The Japanese were hard on the Koreans because they resisted colonization and domination. They had also resisted Chinese overlordship for a thousand years, but they did not have that same deep antipathy for the Chinese . They had adopted the Chinese script and with it had imbibed the teachings of Confucius., loc. 8526-8529, 2021-06-13 22:41:14

A significant reason for South Korea's present political, economic, and social difficulties was that the transition from martial law to free-for-all democratic politics had been too sudden.

To the world at large, Hong Kong and Singapore are two similar Chinese cities of approximately the same size. To me there were as many contrasts as similarities. Hong Kong has twice the land area and twice the population packed on the island, Kowloon peninsula, and the New Territories. Hong Kong had a bleaker economic and political environment in 1949, totally dependent on the mainland's restraint., loc. 8694-8697, 2021-06-13 22:49:07

Unlike Singaporeans, they could not and did not defend themselves or their collective interests. They were not a nation-indeed, were not allowed to become a nation.

When he established textile and garment factories in Singapore in the early 1970s, he brought his Hong Kong managers with him and hired several more Singaporeans. The Singaporean managers were still working for him in 1994, while his Hong Kong managers had set up their own businesses and were competing against him. They saw no reason why they should be working for him when they knew the trade as well as he did . All they needed was a little capital, and the moment they had that, off they went., loc. 8735-8738, 2021-06-13 22:52:01

He invited me to visit China again. I said I would when China had recovered from the Cultural Revolution. That, he said, would take a long time. I countered that they should have no problem getting ahead and doing much better than Singapore because we were the descendants of illiterate, landless peasants from Fujian and Guangdong while they had the progeny of the scholars, mandarins, and literati who had stayed at home. He was silent., loc. 9541-9544, 2021-06-13 23:33:31

The Chinese had never concealed their views, and what the Chinese people said counted.

He was glad he had come and seen Singapore again after 58 years. It was a dramatic transformation and he congratulated me.

But I have the whole of China!", loc. 9618-9620, 2021-06-13 23:40:34

During the 40 to 50 days of turmoil, China had lost control of the situation. The students had used the problems of corruption and inflation to rally people to their cause.

Americans would do well to keep their options open. The Chinese are a different people with a different culture and a different history. They will change at their own pace in their quest for technology and a modern economy, preserving their values and traditions, and maintaining continuity with their past. China-bashing by constantly denigrating them for their lack of democracy and human rights will only antagonize a whole generation of Chinese and make them anti-American and xenophobic.

A History of Future Cities, by 

Their ultimate goal was to build Shanghai as a kind of Canton turned inside out. While Canton had been a large Chinese city with a tiny foreign ghetto, Shanghai would be an enormous white city built around a tiny Chinese ghetto. In the foreigners’ early maps of Shanghai, the walled Chinese city was often left blank, a spot of uncharted territory; when it was included at all, it was often labeled “Chinatown,” as if it were an immigrant enclave on a far-flung continent rather than a mainland Chinese city., loc. 851-855, 2021-06-08 19:53:53

While St. Petersburg’s Western architecture was part of a grandiose plan conceived in the mind of its autocrat, Shanghai’s occidental looks came from a trial-and-error attempt to create practical, comfortable surroundings for its far-flung traders., loc. 871-872, 2021-06-08 19:56:38

By 1847, the Bund was looking like an urban downtown in the West. A hotel, a clubhouse, and several stores had joined the trading firm headquarters. Commerce was booming: in 1844, 12.5 percent of all goods bound for Britain were shipped out of Shanghai; by 1849, it had already reached 40 percent., loc. 874-876, 2021-06-08 19:57:07

Shanghai’s Jewish community, with roots in Baghdad, was careful to identify themselves as Sephardim, a Hebrew term literally meaning “Spaniards,” denoting the descendants of Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Though the Baghdad community’s historical ties to Spain were dubious, by linking themselves to the Iberian Peninsula Shanghai Jews could claim the privileges of being “European” rather than “Oriental,” whites rather than Arabs., loc. 989-992, 2021-06-08 20:10:27

It was Shanghai’s composure during the Tiananmen movement that finally won it the go-ahead to develop Pudong—and ultimately shift all of China to its model of economic openness and political deep freeze, when the ruthlessly efficient pair who ran Shanghai, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, were given the keys to the Middle Kingdom., loc. 4035-4037, 2021-06-09 12:55:22

But after a couple of decades, Shanghai had become run-down and had fallen far behind Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.

With conditions declining in the city even after the ousting of the tsar, Lenin found a sympathetic audience in Petrograd’s workers.

With the city in the hands of the Nationalists, the leaders of the Communist Party deserted Shanghai for the hinterlands of China. Regrouping in the countryside would radically reshape the CCP’s ideology. Rather than a revolution led by urban workers and intellectuals, it envisioned one led by radicalized peasants. Though the Party had been founded in China’s most modern city, in its decades of exile from the metropolis, its ideology would take on a deeply antiurban cast. Mao Zedong’s army of peasants that would eventually “liberate” Shanghai in 1949 had little in common with the urbanites who founded the Party in the French Concession in 1921 and little love for China’s greatest city., loc. 2541-2546, 2021-06-10 23:22:25

Its very successes were the seeds of its destruction. For with each new stunning skyscraper and luxurious nightclub, the metropolis on the Huangpu became more estranged from the rest of China. No matter how large Shanghai grew, China’s greatest city would always be dwarfed by the countryside’s hundreds of millions of peasants, many of whom were now armed under Mao Zedong with China’s capitalist heart in their crosshairs., loc. 2729-2732, 2021-06-10 23:34:09

In the early twentieth century, a vogue for pearl jewelry brought tremendous wealth to the Gulf; its warm shallow waters produced the largest pearls in the world. Bombay merchants seized the moment, sailing to Dubai on buying trips and then trading the pearls on the British-dominated global market from Bombay. With the massive boom, pearling soon composed 95 percent of the Gulf economy. But when the Japanese developed a method of culturing pearls by inserting grit into the oyster rather than relying on chance, the Gulf industry went into steep decline., loc. 3557-3560, 2021-06-11 23:45:48

How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, by

The elaborate shoreline of the Greek littoral meant that most areas of Greece were no more than twenty miles from the sea. This gave a decisive advantage to Greek farmers over their potential competitors in landlocked areas. Because of this advantage in trading high-value products, Greek farmers earned high incomes from control of only small parcels of land. These high incomes enabled them to purchase costly armor.

The drawbacks of anarchy under the megapolitical conditions of industrialism made competition in protection services within the same territory technologically infeasible. The only way to achieve effective protection under those conditions was to command a greater capability to employ violence. Therefore there was little to be gained by attempting to better distinguish that portion of one's taxes that went, in Lane's words, "as payment for the service rendered" from "another part that one is tempted to call plunder."41 The distinction was surely real enough. But since one was stuck paying the taxes in any event, developing it fully had little to commend it other than satisfying morbid curiosity. As Lane said, no matter what portion of the taxes was plunder they were a price one had to pay "to avoid more severe losses.", loc. 3190-3196, 2021-05-24 11:20:51

Use of the new monetary system will therefore probably involve a more explicit transaction cost, perhaps a fee on the order of 1 percent per annum. This will be a small price to pay compared to the annual inflationary penalty of from 2.7 percent to 99 percent imposed by nationstates., loc. 3902-3904, 2021-05-25 09:01:11

Conventional thinkers reviewing our argument at this point would conclude that the breakdown of income redistribution in the leading nationstates would doom the world to economic collapse. Do not believe it. We do not gainsay the fact that a transition crisis would be likely. But the view that the state improves the functioning of the economy by massive reallocation of resources is an anachronism, an article of faith roughly equivalent to the widespread superstitions at the close of the Middle Ages that fasting and flagellation were beneficial for a community., loc. 3946-3950, 2021-05-25 14:16:30

As the economies of more countries more deeply assimilate information technology, they will see the emergence-so evident already in North America-of a more or less unemployable underclass.

The social lives of foragers are characterized by a depth and intensity of interaction few of us could imagine (or tolerate). For those of us born and raised in societies organized around the interlocking principles of individuality, personal space, and private property, it’s difficult to project our imaginations into those tightly woven societies where almost all space and property is communal, and identity is more collective than individual., loc. 1478-1481, 2021-05-14 23:50:17

“If one of them scores (sexually), he is not possessive, but is only too happy to see his team-mates succeed with the same girl.” While this may strike some as unfeeling, Morris assured his readers that this lack of jealousy was “simply a measure of the extent to which selfishness is suppressed between team-mates, both on the field and off it.”, loc. 1541-1544, 2021-05-14 23:54:49

“A natural family.” Perhaps this easy acceptance between adults and unrelated children, the diffuse nurturing found in societies where children refer to all men as father and all women as mother, societies small and isolated enough to safely assume the kindness of strangers, where overlapping sexual relationships leave genetic paternity unknowable and of little consequence…perhaps this is the “natural” family structure of our species., loc. 1785-1789, 2021-05-15 09:50:33

Robert Farris Thompson, America’s most prominent historian of African art, says that funky is derived from the Ki-Kongo lu-fuki, meaning “positive sweat” of the sort you get from dancing or having sex, but not working. One’s mojo, which has to be “working” to attract a lover, is Ki-Kongo for “soul.” Boogie comes from mbugi, meaning “devilishly good.” And both jazz and jism likely derive from dinza, the Ki-Kongo word for “to ejaculate.”, loc. 1457-1462, 2021-05-15 10:10:57

Otto Kiefer, in his 1934 Sexual Life in Ancient Rome, explains that from the Roman perspective, “Natural and physical laws are alien and even opposed to the marriage tie. Accordingly, the woman who is entering marriage must atone to Mother Nature for violating her, and go through a period of free prostitution, in which she purchases the chastity of marriage by preliminary unchastity.”2, loc. 2033-2036, 2021-05-16 00:06:37

Marriage was celebrated with a wedding orgy in which the husband’s friends had intercourse with the bride, with witnesses standing by.

How to Read a Book (A Touchstone book), by Charles Van Doren

But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all.

Thus we can roughly define what we mean by the art of reading as follows: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside,I elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the various acts that constitute the art of reading., loc. 225-229, 2021-04-29 01:35:25

What are the conditions under which this kind of reading—reading for understanding—takes place? There are two. First, there is initial inequality in understanding. The writer must be “superior” to the reader in understanding, and his book must convey in readable form the insights he possesses and his potential readers lack. Second, the reader must be able to overcome this inequality in some degree, seldom perhaps fully, but always approaching equality with the writer. To the extent that equality is approached, clarity of communication is achieved., loc. 250-254, 2021-04-29 01:40:43

The farmer does many things for his plants or animals, but in the final analysis it is they that must grow in size and excellence.

Students in school often read difficult books with the help and guidance of teachers. But for those of us who are not in school, and indeed also for those of us who are when we try to read books that are not required or assigned, our continuing education depends mainly on books alone, read without a teacher’s help. Therefore if we are disposed to go on learning and discovering, we must know how to make books teach us well. That, indeed, is the primary goal of this book., loc. 331-334, 2021-05-01 03:08:07

There are four main questions you must ask about any book.I 1. WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT AS A WHOLE? You must try to discover the leading theme of the book, and how the author develops this theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into its essential subordinate themes or topics. 2. WHAT IS BEING SAID IN DETAIL, AND HOW? You must try to discover the main ideas, assertions, and arguments that constitute the author’s particular message. 3. IS THE BOOK TRUE, IN WHOLE OR PART? You cannot answer this question until you have answered the first two. You have to know what is being said before you can decide whether it is true or not. When you understand a book, however, you are obligated, if you are reading seriously, to make up your own mind. Knowing the author’s mind is not enough. 4. WHAT OF IT? If the book has given you information, you must ask about its significance. Why does the author think it is important to know these things? Is it important to you to know them? And if the book has not only informed you, but also enlightened you, it is necessary to seek further enlightenment by asking what else follows, what is further implied or suggested., loc. 755-766, 2021-05-01 06:33:15

The rooms are independent, in part. Each has its own structure and interior decoration. But they are not absolutely independent and separate. They are connected by doors and arches, by corridors and stairways, by what architects call a “traffic pattern.” Because they are connected, the partial function that each performs contributes its share to the usefulness of the whole house. Otherwise the house would not be livable., loc. 1169-1175, 2021-05-01 09:32:10

there must be a plan and you must find it., loc. 1184-1184, 2021-05-01 09:33:32

Why is this so? Why should not an expository book, one that attempts to present a body of knowledge in an ordered way, be merely an outline of the subject?, loc. 1374-1375, 2021-05-01 10:02:44

RULE 4. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S PROBLEMS WERE., loc. 1400-1401, 2021-05-01 10:06:18

They will fail to see the unity of a book because they do not see why it has the unity it has;, loc. 1415-1416, 2021-05-01 10:08:03

THE FIRST STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING, OR RULES FOR FINDING WHAT A BOOK IS ABOUT 1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter. 2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. 3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. 4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve., loc. 1441-1445, 2021-05-01 10:13:38

Coming to terms is usually the last step in any successful business negotiation. All that remains is to sign on the dotted line. But in the analytical reading of a book, coming to terms is the first step beyond the outline. Unless the reader comes to terms with the author, the communication of knowledge from one to the other does not take place. For a term is the basic element of communicable knowledge., loc. 1450-1453, 2021-05-01 10:15:05

a term is a word used unambiguously., loc. 1466-1467, 2021-05-01 10:16:32

the best poetry is that which is the most richly ambiguous, and it has been said with justice that any good poet is sometimes intentionally ambiguous in his writing. This is an important insight about poetry to which we will return later., loc. 1475-1477, 2021-05-01 10:43:32

the best poetry is that which is the most richly ambiguous, and it has been said with justice that any good poet is sometimes intentionally ambiguous in his writing., loc. 1475-1476, 2021-05-01 10:43:39

You cannot locate the key words without making an effort to understand the passage in which they occur., loc. 1543-1543, 2021-05-01 10:51:06

From your point of view as a reader, therefore, the most important words are those that give you trouble., loc. 1547-1548, 2021-05-01 10:51:27

When you find an author telling you how a particular word has been used by others, and why he chooses to use it otherwise, you can be sure that word makes a great difference to him., loc. 1586-1587, 2021-05-01 11:22:10

The reader who fails to ponder, or at least to mark, the words he does not understand is headed for disaster., loc. 1595-1595, 2021-05-01 11:22:53

The answer is that you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of all the other words in the context that you do understand., loc. 1611-1612, 2021-05-01 11:24:56

you will find that your comprehension of any book will be enormously increased if you only go to the trouble of finding its important words, identifying their shifting meanings, and coming to terms. Seldom does such a small change in a habit have such a large effect., loc. 1696-1698, 2021-05-01 11:32:34

the order of reading reverses the order of business. Businessmen usually come to terms after they find out what the proposition is. But the reader must usually come to terms with an author first, before he can find out what the author is proposing, what judgment he is declaring., loc. 1708-1710, 2021-05-01 11:34:08

His propositions are nothing but expressions of personal opinion unless they are supported by reasons., loc. 1713-1714, 2021-05-01 11:46:31

outlining and interpretation, meet at the level of propositions and arguments. You work down to propositions and arguments by dividing the book into its parts. You work up to arguments by seeing how they are composed of propositions and ultimately of terms. When you have completed the two processes, you can really say that you know the contents of a book., loc. 1738-1741, 2021-05-01 11:48:17

Sentences and paragraphs are grammatical units. They are units of language. Propositions and arguments are logical units, or units of thought and knowledge., loc. 1743-1744, 2021-05-01 11:48:39

prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and from their women., loc. 1768-1770, 2021-05-02 09:26:47

Perhaps you are beginning to see how essential a part of reading it is to be perplexed and know it., loc. 1833-1833, 2021-05-02 09:32:44

Indeed, this is one of the greatest obstacles to reading a book that is not completely contemporary. Any old book contains facts that are somewhat surprising because they are different from what we know. But when you are reading for understanding it is not that kind of novelty that you are seeking. Your interest in the author himself, or in his language, or in the world in which he wrote, is one thing; your concern to understand his ideas is quite another., loc. 1852-1855, 2021-05-02 09:35:35

“State in your own words!”, loc. 1871-1872, 2021-05-02 09:38:38

There is one other test of whether you understand the proposition in a sentence you have read. Can you point to some experience you have had that the proposition describes or to which the proposition is in any way relevant?, loc. 1895-1896, 2021-05-02 09:42:06

Unless you can show some acquaintance with actual or possible facts to which the proposition refers or is relevant somehow, you are playing with words, not dealing with thought and knowledge., loc. 1901-1902, 2021-05-02 09:42:36

The failure in reading—the omnipresent verbalism—of those who have not been trained in the arts of grammar and logic shows how lack of such discipline results in slavery to words rather than mastery of them., loc. 1914-1916, 2021-05-02 09:45:27

One of the most familiar tricks of the orator or propagandist is to leave certain things unsaid, things that are highly relevant to the argument, but that might be challenged if they were made explicit. While we do not expect such devices in an honest author whose aim is to instruct us, it is nevertheless a sound maxim of careful reading to make every step in an argument explicit., loc. 1952-1954, 2021-05-02 09:51:59

observe what things the author says he must assume, what he says can be proved or otherwise evidenced, and what need not be proved because it is self-evident., loc. 1977-1978, 2021-05-03 03:29:12

This final step in interpretive reading is covered by RULE 8. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S SOLUTIONS ARE. When you have applied this rule, and the three that precede it in interpretive reading, you can feel reasonably sure that you have managed to understand the book., loc. 2019-2021, 2021-05-03 03:32:06

THE SECOND STAGE OF ANALYTICAL READING, OR RULES FOR FINDING WHAT A BOOK SAYS (INTERPRETING ITS CONTENTS) 5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words. 6. Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences. 7. Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences. 8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve., loc. 2032-2037, 2021-05-03 03:32:57

Reading a book is a kind of conversation., loc. 2041-2042, 2021-05-03 03:34:53

Remember Bacon’s recommendation to the reader: “Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.” Sir Walter Scott casts even more dire aspersions on those “who read to doubt or read to scorn.”, loc. 2071-2073, 2021-05-03 03:37:08

We are discussing here the virtue of teachability—a virtue that is almost always misunderstood. Teachability is often confused with subservience., loc. 2081-2082, 2021-05-03 03:38:40

No one is really teachable who does not freely exercise his power of independent judgment. He can be trained, perhaps, but not taught. The most teachable reader is, therefore, the most critical. He is the reader who finally, loc. 2083-2084, 2021-05-03 03:40:14

No one is really teachable who does not freely exercise his power of independent judgment. He can be trained, perhaps, but not taught. The most teachable reader is, therefore, the most critical., loc. 2083-2084, 2021-05-03 03:40:21

To be equally serious in receiving such communication, one must be not only a responsive but also a responsible listener, loc. 2098-2099, 2021-05-03 03:43:19

To be equally serious in receiving such communication, one must be not only a responsive but also a responsible listener. You are responsive to the extent that you follow what has been said and note the intention that prompts it. But you also have the responsibility of taking a position., loc. 2098-2100, 2021-05-03 03:43:32

To regard anyone except yourself as responsible for your judgment is to be a slave, not a free man. It is from this fact that the liberal arts acquire their name., loc. 2101-2102, 2021-05-03 03:44:17

Suspending Judgment, loc. 2106-2107, 2021-05-03 03:47:56

Do not begin to talk back until you have listened carefully and are sure you understand. Not until you are honestly satisfied that you have accomplished the first two stages of reading should you feel free to express yourself. When you have, you not only have earned the right, loc. 2112-2114, 2021-05-03 03:48:37

Do not begin to talk back until you have listened carefully and are sure you understand. Not until you are honestly satisfied that you have accomplished the first two stages of reading should you feel free to express yourself. When you have, you not only have earned the right to turn critic, you also have the duty to do so., loc. 2112-2114, 2021-05-03 03:48:41

suspending judgment is also an act of criticism. It is taking the position that something has not been shown. You are saying that you are not convinced or persuaded one way or the other., loc. 2125-2126, 2021-05-03 03:50:49

someone said to a speaker, in one breath or at most two, “I don’t know what you mean, but I think you’re wrong.”, loc. 2133-2133, 2021-05-03 03:51:45

where someone said to a speaker, in one breath or at most two, “I don’t know what you mean, but I think you’re wrong.” There is actually no point in answering critics of this sort. The only polite thing to do is to ask them to state your position for you, the position they claim to be challenging. If they cannot do it satisfactorily, if they cannot repeat what you have said in their own words, you know that they do not understand, and you are entirely justified in ignoring their criticisms, loc. 2133-2136, 2021-05-03 03:52:10

When you find the rare person who shows that he understands what you are saying as well as you do, then you can delight in his agreement or be seriously disturbed by his dissent., loc. 2137-2138, 2021-05-03 03:53:10

WHEN YOU DISAGREE, DO SO REASONABLY, AND NOT DISPUTATIOUSLY OR CONTENTIOUSLY. There is no point in winning an argument if you know or suspect you are wrong., loc. 2165-2166, 2021-05-03 03:56:43

We learned this maxim first from Plato and Aristotle. In a passage in the Symposium, this interchange occurs: I cannot refute you, Socrates, said Agathon: Let us assume that what you say is true. Say rather, Agathon, that you cannot refute the truth; for Socrates is easily refuted., loc. 2167-2170, 2021-05-03 03:58:03

But if he realizes that the only profit in conversation, with living or dead teachers, is what one can learn from them, if he realizes that you win only by gaining knowledge, not by knocking the other fellow down, he may see the futility of mere contentiousness., loc. 2181-2183, 2021-05-03 22:00:10

Where the second maxim urged you not to disagree disputatiously, this one warns you against disagreeing hopelessly., loc. 2190-2191, 2021-05-03 22:01:44

These two facts, that people do disagree and can agree, arise from the complexity of human nature. Men are rational animals. Their rationality is the source of their power to agree. Their animality, and the imperfections of their reason that it entails, is the cause of most of the disagreements that occur., loc. 2194-2196, 2021-05-03 23:53:59

He does not judge the book but the man., loc. 2228-2228, 2021-05-04 22:35:44

The reader who does not distinguish between the reasoned statement of knowledge and the flat expression of opinion is not reading to learn. He is at most interested in the author’s personality and is using the book as a case history. Such a reader will, of course, neither agree nor disagree. He does not judge the book but the man., loc. 2226-2228, 2021-05-04 22:35:52

Not simply by following an author’s arguments, but only by meeting them as well, can the reader ultimately reach significant agreement or disagreement with his author., loc. 2264-2265, 2021-05-05 04:15:52

You must know what your prejudices—that is, your prejudgments—are. Otherwise you are not likely to admit that your opponent may be equally entitled to different assumptions. Good controversy should not be a quarrel about assumptions., loc. 2293-2294, 2021-05-05 13:59:08

After he has said, “I understand but I disagree,” he can make the following remarks to the author: (1) “You are uninformed”; (2) “You are misinformed”; (3) “You are illogical—your reasoning is not cogent”; (4) “Your analysis is incomplete.”, loc. 2310-2313, 2021-05-05 14:00:25

There is the non sequitur, which means that what is drawn as a conclusion simply does not follow from the reasons offered. And there is the occurrence of inconsistency, which means that two things the author has tried to say are incompatible., loc. 2348-2350, 2021-05-05 14:06:00

In general, fallacies are of two sorts. There is the non sequitur, which means that what is drawn as a conclusion simply does not follow from the reasons offered. And there is the occurrence of inconsistency, which means that two things the author has tried to say are incompatible., loc. 2348-2350, 2021-05-05 14:06:10

(If, despite your failure to support one or more of these three critical points, you still honestly feel unconvinced, perhaps you should not have said you understood in the first place.), loc. 2380-2382, 2021-05-05 14:08:48

Because of the limitations of his time and his erroneous acceptance of slavery, Aristotle fails to consider, or for that matter even to conceive, the truly democratic constitution that is based on universal suffrage; nor can he imagine either representative government or the modern kind of federated state., loc. 2389-2391, 2021-05-05 14:09:33

This fourth point is strictly not a basis for disagreement. It is critically adverse only to the extent that it marks the limitations of the author’s achievement., loc. 2396-2398, 2021-05-05 14:10:22

A reader who agrees with a book in part—because he finds no reason to make any of the other points of adverse criticism—may, nevertheless, suspend judgment on the whole, in the light of this fourth point about the book’s incompleteness., loc. 2398-2399, 2021-05-05 14:10:41

Books win the plaudits of the critics and gain widespread popular attention almost to the extent that they flout the truth—the more outrageously they do so, the better., loc. 2444-2445, 2021-05-06 02:34:21

In many cases, they read fewer books than are now required in most of our colleges, but what they did read, they read well. Because they had mastered these books, they became peers with their authors. They were entitled to become authorities in their own right., loc. 2466-2468, 2021-05-07 06:29:18

How do you know whether you are making proper use of your experience to help you understand a book? The surest test is one we have already recommended as a test of understanding: ask yourself whether you can give a concrete example of a point that you feel you understand., loc. 2526-2528, 2021-05-07 06:32:50

He says over and over that virtue is a mean between the extremes of defect and excess., loc. 2530-2531, 2021-05-07 06:33:36

Or they may try all these without having read Montesquieu’s The Spirit of Laws, Rousseau’s The Social Contract, and Locke’s second treatise Of Civil Government., loc. 2540-2541, 2021-05-07 06:34:27

It has often been observed that the great books are involved in a prolonged conversation. The great authors were great readers, and one way to understand them is to read the books they read., loc. 2547-2548, 2021-05-07 06:35:11

To join this conversation, we must read the great books in relation to one another, and in an order that somehow respects chronology., loc. 2549-2550, 2021-05-07 06:35:38

WORDS ARE CONVENTIONAL. They are man-made signs. That is why every word has a history, a cultural career in the course of which it goes through certain transformations. The history of words is given by their etymological derivation from original word-roots, prefixes, and suffixes; it includes the account of their physical changes, both in spelling and pronunciation; it tells of the shifting meanings, and which among them are archaic and obsolete, which are current and regular,, loc. 2668-2671, 2021-05-08 13:21:08

But it is just as vain to try to read an encyclopedia through as a dictionary. The man who knew an encyclopedia by heart would be in grave danger of incurring the title idiot savant—“learned fool.”, loc. 2679-2681, 2021-05-08 13:21:54

seven liberal arts—grammar, rhetoric, and logic, the trivium; arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music, the quadrivium., loc. 2691-2692, 2021-05-08 13:23:06

FACTS ARE TO SOME EXTENT CONVENTIONAL. Facts change, we say., loc. 2742-2743, 2021-05-09 07:13:42

But the primitive may not agree with the scientist’s facts about nuclear particles, just as the scientist may not agree with the primitive’s facts about ritual magic., loc. 2750-2752, 2021-05-09 07:14:49

The most important thing to remember about any practical book is that it can never solve the practical problems with which it is concerned. A theoretical book can solve its own problems. But a practical problem can only be solved by action itself., loc. 2794-2795, 2021-05-09 11:12:00

That is what it means to say that nothing but action solves practical problems, and action occurs only in the world, not in books., loc. 2800-2801, 2021-05-09 11:13:45

Practical books thus fall into two main groups. Some, like this one, or a cookbook, or a driver’s manual, are primarily presentations of rules. Whatever other discussion they contain is for the sake of the rules. There are few great books of this sort. The other kind of practical book is primarily concerned with the principles that generate rules. Most of the great books, loc. 2814-2816, 2021-05-09 21:38:12

Practical books thus fall into two main groups. Some, like this one, or a cookbook, or a driver’s manual, are primarily presentations of rules. Whatever other discussion they contain is for the sake of the rules. There are few great books of this sort. The other kind of practical book is primarily concerned with the principles that generate rules. Most of the great books in economics, politics, and morals are of this sort., loc. 2814-2817, 2021-05-09 21:38:19

And your judgment of his book as practically true or practically false will be made accordingly. If you do not think careful and intelligent reading is worth doing, this book has little practical truth for you, however sound its rules may be., loc. 2845-2847, 2021-05-10 22:20:06

In judging a practical book, everything turns on the ends or goals. If, loc. 2848-2849, 2021-05-10 22:21:00

In judging a practical book, everything turns on the ends or goals., loc. 2848-2849, 2021-05-10 22:21:04

In judging a practical book, everything turns on the ends or goals. If you do not share Karl Marx’s fervor about economic justice, his economic doctrine and the reforms it suggests are likely to seem to you practically false or irrelevant., loc. 2848-2850, 2021-05-10 22:21:15

Since your ultimate judgment of his work is going to turn on your acceptance of the goal for which he is proposing means, it is up to him to win you to his ends. To do this, he has to argue in a way that appeals to your heart as well as your mind. He may have to play on your emotions and gain direction of your will., loc. 2864-2866, 2021-05-10 22:22:36

The best protection against propaganda of any sort is the recognition of it for what it is. Only hidden and undetected oratory is really insidious. What reaches the heart without going through the mind is likely to bounce back and put the mind out of business. Propaganda taken in that way is like a drug you do not know you are swallowing. The effect is mysterious; you do not know afterwards why you feel or think the way you do., loc. 2870-2873, 2021-05-10 22:23:54

Beauty is harder to analyze than truth., loc. 2950-2950, 2021-05-11 08:31:18

The problem of knowing how to read imaginative literature is inherently much more difficult than the problem of knowing how to read expository books. Nevertheless, it seems to be a fact that such skill is more widely possessed than the art of reading science and philosophy, politics, economics, and history. How can this be true?, loc. 2941-2943, 2021-05-11 08:31:39

This fact about imaginative literature leads to what is probably the most important of the negative injunctions we want to suggest. Don’t try to resist the effect that a work of imaginative literature has on you., loc. 2966-2967, 2021-05-11 08:33:58

From this fact we obtain another negative injunction. Don’t look for terms, propositions, and arguments in imaginative literature., loc. 2986-2987, 2021-05-11 08:37:49

Expository works do not provide us with novel experiences. They comment on such experiences as we already have or can get. That is why it seems right to say that expository books teach primarily, while imaginative books teach only derivatively, by creating experiences from which we can learn., loc. 2995-2997, 2021-05-11 12:45:25

Finally, one last negative rule. Don’t criticize fiction by the standards of truth and consistency that properly apply to communication of knowledge., loc. 2998-2999, 2021-05-11 12:45:37

The Rational Optimist, by 

the ubiquitous pessimist will confront the rational optimist with his two trump cards: Africa and climate., loc. 4314-4315, 2021-05-01 11:52:11

‘completely unsustainable population growth in most of Africa will keep it permanently, hopelessly, stuck in deepest, darkest poverty.’, loc. 4318-4319, 2021-05-01 11:52:20

Africa faces an especially stark dilemma: get rich by burning more carbon and then suffer the climate consequences; or join the rest of the world in taking action against climate change and continue to wallow in poverty. That is the conventional wisdom., loc. 4334-4336, 2021-05-01 11:53:39

Paul Collier and his colleagues at the World Bank, loc. 4357-4358, 2021-05-01 11:55:42

Take, therefore, one such typical African country. It is landlocked, drought-prone and has a very high population growth rate. Its people belong to eight different tribes speaking different tongues. When freed from colonial rule in 1966 it had eight miles of paved road (for an area the size of Texas), twenty-two black university graduates, and only 100 secondary school graduates. It was later cursed by a huge diamond mine, crippled by AIDS, devastated by cattle disease, and ruled by one party with little effective opposition. Government spending has remained high; so has wealth inequality. This country, the fourth poorest in the entire world in 1950, has every one of Africa’s curses. Its failure was inevitable and predictable. But Botswana did not fail., loc. 4405-4411, 2021-05-01 12:00:34

good institutions. In particular, Botswana turns out to have secure, enforceable property rights that are fairly widely distributed and fairly well respected., loc. 4416-4417, 2021-05-01 12:01:42

experiencing almost as little direct European imperialism as those later success stories of Asia – places like Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China., loc. 4431-4432, 2021-05-01 12:03:42

Use Western aid to create a new ‘charter city’ in Africa on uninhabited land, free to trade with the rest of the world, and allow it to draw in people from the surrounding nations. It worked for Tyre 3,000 years ago, for Amsterdam 300 years ago and for Hong Kong thirty years ago., loc. 4522-4524, 2021-05-02 03:28:59

This effect, together with greater rainfall and new techniques, means that less habitat will probably be lost to farming in a warmer world. Indeed under the warmest scenario, much land could revert to wilderness, leaving only 5 per cent of the world under the plough in 2100, compared with 11.6 per cent today, allowing more space for wilderness. The richest and warmest version of the future will have the least hunger, and will have ploughed the least extra land to feed itself.

Five hundred years later, modern-day explorers still seek alien cultures, hoping therein to find models of enlightened justice, collective well-being, or personal liberation. Of course, nobody today believes, as did Columbus, that such a hidden country—an El Dorado or Shangri–la—will be found in some forgotten physical corner of the planet. And so, the voyage has taken an intellectual turn: By travelling to the ends of the humanities, some hope to recreate a lost utopia that can serve as a conceptual alternative to the modern West, as a vehicle á la Montaigne for denouncing unpalatable aspects of our society., loc. 448-452, 2021-04-24 11:57:04

Remarkably, however, Stanford's multicultural leaders have made clear that these commonsense answers are not the ones they have in mind. As understood at Stanford, multiculturalism has next to nothing to do with a thorough study of other cultures. Confucius and Solzhenitzyn are nowhere on the list of multicultural priorities. Chinese, Japanese, Slavic, Indian, Arabic, African, or Latin American cultures have nothing to do with the OMD's vision of an “interdependent, multi-racial/multi-ethnic” future, and neither do the non-Western world religions, such as Islam, Buddhism, or Hinduism. Nor are student and faculty activists ever found marching in favor of new language requirements. On the contrary, the study of other languages simply is unrelated to the multicultural “transformation.”, loc. 1090-1095, 2021-04-27 00:57:55

Similarly, traffic dynamics can be efficiently inefficient. For example, consider what happens when you drive on a busy highway. Each lane moves approximately equally fast because lane-switchers ensure a relatively even number of cars in each lane. However, the lanes don’t move exactly equally fast because of the “cost” of switching lanes and the evolving traffic situation. Lane speeds probably tend to reach an efficiently inefficient level where switching lanes hardly helps, but doing so still makes sense for those with comparative advantages in lane switching—although frequent lane switching and high speed increase the risk of driving, just as frequent trading and high leverage increase the risk in financial markets., loc. 393-398, 2021-01-20 00:02:21

Many guys learn this the hard way. They assume their recovered erections mean they can use porn or porn substitutes, only to end up with ED again. Deeply etched porn pathways can easily spring back to life., loc. 1764-1766, 2020-03-21 02:31:07

It seems that the battle to overcome porn is literally a battle between the rational, planning functions and the more emotional, reactive parts of the brain. Meditation is probably the best tool for putting the pre-frontal cortex in the driver’s seat. Creative pursuits, hobbies, life purpose The first few weeks are primarily a battle of distraction. Put all your extra time, energy and confidence to use on other efforts that keep you preoccupied. A rebooter explained the importance of filling your time differently by exploring and learning new things: You can't expect to live the exact same lifestyle you've been living, (i.e., get up, do a little work, surf web, do a little more work, surf web, surf NSFW, do a little work, surf web, etc.) and expect anything to change. That pattern won't magically disappear without conscious effort. Your brain will thank you. And, just like learning new things, creativity is both a great distraction and inherently rewarding because of the anticipation of achieving something important to you: I enjoy music, and quitting has helped both my creative ability for music, as well as my enjoyment of listening to it. I've probably ‘composed’ about 20 songs in my head in the last few months since quitting. Also, I've found I'm much more creative with my jokes and conversational threads. All of a sudden conversations feel like playing music. It is both enjoyable and impressive, actually. I am planning to join the Improv club at university, and see where I can take this. Stage-performance doesn't seem daunting at all, anymore. Exciting, if anything. * I'm a writer and musician, though I have let my art fall by the wayside over the past few years as I retreated farther and farther into porn. I thought that I was dealing with writer's block because I could not allow myself to put words on paper or notes on strings. Since I started this journey, however, I have recommitted myself to my art and am now working on three songs with a fourth starting to work its way out of me. Many people report taking up hobbies, new and old, as they reboot. Here are comments of three guys: I've taken up cooking and baking. It's a great distraction, it's fun, and I get a reward when I'm finished. *, loc. 1944-1966, 2020-03-21 02:58:22
